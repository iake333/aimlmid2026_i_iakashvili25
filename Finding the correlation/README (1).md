# Pearson Correlation Analysis

Hi! In this project, I explored the relationship between two sets of data points using **Pearson's correlation coefficient**. My goal was to determine how strongly and in what direction the variables are related, and to visualize this relationship effectively.

Here's what I did in this project:

1. **Data Preparation:** I defined two arrays of data points for `x` and `y` values that represent the variables I wanted to analyze.  
2. **Correlation Analysis:** I calculated **Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)** and the **p-value** to quantify the strength and significance of the linear relationship.  
3. **Linear Regression:** I computed the **regression line** to describe the trend of the data and added it to the plot for clear visualization.  
4. **Data Visualization:** I created a **scatter plot** with:
   - Annotated data points showing exact `(x, y)` coordinates  
   - A dashed regression line with correlation information  
   - Gridlines and reference axes for clarity  
   - A text box summarizing correlation, p-value, number of points, and regression equation  
5. **Summary Statistics:** I calculated and displayed the **mean** and **standard deviation** of both variables to provide additional context about the dataset.  
6. **Output:** The visualization was saved as `pearson_correlation_analysis.png` for easy sharing and reporting.

By completing this project, I improved my understanding of **statistical correlation**, **linear regression**, and **Python data visualization techniques** using `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`. It also helped me practice presenting statistical results in a clear and interpretable way.
